# Garage-FSM
This lab can be segmented into three tasks: create an FSM that models enter/exit behavior of a vehicle garage, create a counting mechanism to keep track of number of enters and exists, and lastly output the count onto a display all on Quartus. Then simulate these approaches on ModelSim and demonstrate them on an FPGA.
